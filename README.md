# Covid-19-Recovery-Prediction-model
This repository contains the implementation and analysis of a Covid-19 recovery prediction model using various machine learning algorithms. The goal of this project is to compare the performance of different models in predicting patient recovery outcomes based on Malaysia Covid-19 datasets.

*Algorithms Implemented:*
- K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)
- Neural network (NN)
- Linear Regression (LR)
- Random Forest Regressor (RFR)

*Comparison Metrics:*
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Correlation Coefficient (RÂ²)
- Training speed
